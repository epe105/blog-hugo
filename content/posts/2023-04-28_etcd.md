When working with ETCDCTL, making sure to export the etcdctl_api version to version 3, so you can use etcdctl to take snapshot of your etcd database.  You can do this by exporting ETCDCTL_API as a environment variable.  If you don't do this, ETCDCTL will not work.

```
$ export ETDCT_API=3
```

Then make sure to check the api version.

```
$ etcdctl version
```

If it's not version 3.X, then commands sucn etcdctl snapshot save may give you an error.
