I bought the domain of mannyevangelista.com for this site.  But now I get that ugly "site not secure warning".  The provider will let me use their "free" lets encrypt ssl certificate feature, but only if upgrade to their basic hosting model.  I'm only using this site as an excuse to blog my technical adventures.  So for now, I'll pass and pay for it once I need it.

I did ask chatgpt what other hosting sites I can use that offers Let's Encyrpt SSL certificates.  It came up with:

- Bluehost
- SiteGround
- DreamHost
- HostGator
- A2 Hosting

I'll have to research these and see if it's worht moving over.
