Because I'm re-learning ECS, I'm naturally re-learning about fargate.  Fargate is a serverless container service where you don't have to manage anything infrastructure.  It's similar to ECS where you create a ECS Cluster Controlplane (master in K8s), Task Definitions (deployments in K8s), and Services.  But you don't have to manage anything.  There is no ec2 instances to managed.  It's very opinionated, but in a very easy way.  I can see why it's so compelling.

EKS with Fargate is also compelling, since you don't have to manage worker nodes.  You can still take advantage of the K8s API, but have Fargate manage the worker nodes.
