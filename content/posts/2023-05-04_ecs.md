I'm re-learning ECS.  I did work with ECS when I was getting my AWS Certs, so it's been a while since I've been hands-on with it.  But it's interesting how ECS compares and contrasts with Kubernetes.  
- ECS has some high level similarities such as having nodes managed by a cluster.  
- The nodes run on EC2 Nodes like EKS does.  
- Task Definitions are essentially similar to deployments and pods and have some of the same constructs.
- A ECS Service doesn't exactly have an equivilant to K8s.  
    - It tells where you should run the *pod/deployment*.  Either on an EC2 node or on Fargate
    - So all you have to do is create task definitions, and if you choose Fargate then you don't have to manage the nodes.
- The Docker agent is what registers the Node to the Cluster, but in Kubernetes, the Kubelet is what does that.  But a lot of K8s clusters leverage the docker agent for running containers like ECS does, but it's going through OCI.  I don't think ECS leverages OCI, but I don't know for sure.
