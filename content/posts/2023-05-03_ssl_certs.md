Working with SSL certificates has always been confusing to me.  One analogy that helps me  is thinking of the Private Key as a key and the Public Key as a Lock.  You lock the data with the Public Key(Lock) and you can only unlock the data with the Private Key(Key).  Since they are both Keys, you have to be careful to lock the data with the public key.  That's the beauty of assymetric encryption.  

Public Keys usually end in .crt or .pem.  Private Keys usually end in .key or .key-pem.  Certificates from the certificate authority (CA) are typically referred to as root certificates.
